# Password Sorcerer - Vue/TypeScript

Vue Typescript implementation of a password generator application.

## Purpose

Password Sorcerer began as an application used to display VueJS knowledge and use TypeScript in a project for the first time.

## Current Project State

At the moment, this project is complete and more featuresa aren't planned in the immediate future. Eventually, more features may be added, such as saved password templates & minimum amounts of each character type. At the moment I'm simply testing out different languages for future projects.
